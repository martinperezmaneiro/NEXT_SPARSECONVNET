Welcome to NEXT_SPARSEONVNET  documentation!
===================================

**NEXT_SPARSECONVET** is a module for using SparseConvNet on NEXT data.

In this page we will explain how to work with the `NEXT_SPARSECONVNET <https://github.com/martinperezmaneiro/NEXT_SPARSECONVNET.git>`_ repository to train and use the implemented DNNs.

How to set up all the requirements to run the net can be found in the :doc:`setup` section. The structure of the repository is outlined in the :doc:`structure` section. General explanations on how to operate the net and understand the config files are located in the :doc:`usage` section. How to create jobs for specific machines is sketched in :doc:`run`.

.. note::

   This project is under active development, and so is its documentation.

.. note::

   Some points in the :doc:`setup` section can be uncomplete, or may not work in a certain machine.
